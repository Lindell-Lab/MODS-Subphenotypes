<h1>Dysregulated STAT3 signaling and T cell immunometabolic dysfunction
define a targetable, high mortality subphenotype of pediatric critical
illness

<p>Sepsis is the leading cause of death of hospitalized children
worldwide.</p>
<p>Despite the established link between immune dysregulation and
mortality in pediatric sepsis, <b>it remains unclear which host immune
factors contribute causally to adverse sepsis outcomes.</b> Identifying
modifiable pathobiology is an essential first step to successful
translation of biologic insights into precision therapeutics.</p>
<p>We designed a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of 88 critically
ill pediatric patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS),
including patients with and without sepsis, to define <b>subphenotypes
associated with targetable mechanisms of immune dysregulation.</b></p>
